#Task1
The program in the task1.py is a even-odd checker.
The code is written by using simple if-else.
The number is prompted from user and the condition(num/2==0) is written inside the if, _if it is true_ it will print the _number is even_.
else it will print the _number is odd_.

#Task2
a = range(1, 51, 1)
-This creates a range object from 1 up to 50, including 1 but excluding 51.
-The third argument 1 is the step, meaning “count by 1”.
-So a represents: [1,2,3,4,5,.......50]
This loops through each number in the range 1 to 50.
-total = total + i
-For each i in the range, it adds i to total.

_So total keeps increasing until all numbers are added._
